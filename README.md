# Demon Slayer Card Game
This is a prototype, based on Demon Slayer anime, of a card game to measure response time from users.

The game shows a card and the user must select one of 4 other cards that is similar to the one exhibited.

Written using Godot game engine, as a POC for some games I'm developing as a digital treatment for ADHD and other disorders.
